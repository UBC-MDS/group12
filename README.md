### Introduction


### 1. Dataset
Heart Attack dataset

### 2. Research Question
To be discussed

### 3. Data Analysis
Supervised machine learning (for predictive research question)
Data preprocessing based on observations from EDA
Model selection:
conduct cross validation on various classifiers (or regressor). E.g. Dummy as baseline, KNN, SVM, NaiveBayes, Ridge, or Logistic). Pick the model with better performance. or we can just pick on that we think is suitable.
hyperparameter tuning using RandomSearch
Model assessment using test score. (we can also use new metrics that we just learned like precision, recall, ROC etc.)
Prediction on test data as an approximate for its performance on deployment data


Statistical inference (for inferential research questions)
We could choose one of the following two goals.
Estimating population parameter
sample estimate & bootstrapping for CI of the estimate
or MLE ( need to assume a distribution family)
Hypothesis testing via bootstrapping or classical approach(CLT)

### 4. EDA
- table
- figure

### 5. Sharing the results
For inferential: share the result using visualization, box plot with observations
For predictive: share model assessment.
