# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers commit to ensuring that participation in our project and community is free from harassment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. This is done in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being open. We are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. Since the experiences and skill sets of other individuals add to the effectiveness of our overall efforts, we are open to constructive criticism and recommendations.
* Showing empathy towards other community members. Whether in person or online, we pay close attention to what we say and are diplomatic when dealing with opposing viewpoints.
* Being respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* Using welcoming and inclusive language. We encourage a culture where anybody may engage and everyone can make a difference by accepting those who choose to partake in our activities.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexual language or images, as well as unwanted attempts or attention
* Trolls, offensive language, and political and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* A physical or electronic address, or other private information, published without express consent
* Other actions that can be regarded unsuitable in a professional context

## Our Responsibilities

The rules of acceptable behaviour must be made clear by project maintainers, who are also expected to respond to any instances of improper behaviour with appropriate and just corrective action.

In the event that a participant behaves in a manner that is contrary to this code of conduct, the community may take any necessary action, including warning the offender or expelling the offender from the community.

## Scope

When a member is representing a project or its community, the code of conduct is in effect both inside project spaces and in public areas. Using an official project email address, publishing via an official social media account, or serving as a designated representative at an offline or online event are a few examples of representing a project or community. Project maintainers may provide additional definitions and clarifications on project representation.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at tiffany.timbers@stat.ubc.ca. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
